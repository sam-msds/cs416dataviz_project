	<h1>Coronavirus in the U.S.: Comparitive study on U.S. states and territories</h1>

	<p>As of Mar. 20, there have been more than 103 million confirmed coronavirus infections in the United States and more than 1 million people have died of COVID-19.
		In this website, we will study covid 19 trends like cumulative cases, incremental cases, deaths for the overall United States. And then we will see the same analysis
		for each state and territory in the United States to do a comparative analysis. This will help in understanding if the specific state growth rate matches with national average
		or the state has a different trend to reveal.
		We will also study a treemap where we can find how each state is contributing towards national case count.
		</p>
